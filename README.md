# **UFOs**
## **Overview**
> In this project, we use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a webpage that display information on different UFO sightings around the world. This data is stored in a table that was created with the D3.js library. Additionally, we have written functions to manipulate the table data in a Filter Search. Since there is a lot of information on this webpage, the Filter Search allows the user to view only the information that is of interest to them. Below, we will walk through how the filters work.

## **How to Use Filter Search**

### **Navigate to Filter Search**
1. Scroll Down to the Table
    ![](https://github.com/annaS000/UFOs-pages/blob/main/static/images/fixed-format-1.jpg?raw=true)
    > Here, you will a table of UFO sighting data. Above this table, you will find a button (pointed out with the red arrow) that will take the user to a Filter Search in a sidebar.
2. **Click the Filter Button**

    > Once clicked, the sidebar will appear. Now, the user may use the input fields (these have been labeled with the red asterisks) by typing their desired results. The user does not have to use all given fields if they choose not to; the table will only filter the information submitted.
3. **Enter Searches to Filter**
    ![]() 
    >Once the user has typed in the results they would like to see, after the user has hit the `Enter` key, the filters will then show all data that match the input searches. If the user would like to see the original table again they may refresh the page or clear the fields they no longer wish to see and press `Enter` again.

## **Summary**
### **Original Assignment**
![](https://github.com/annaS000/UFOs-pages/blob/main/static/images/original-page.png?raw=true)
>In the original assignment, we were just asked to create filters for the table and have the input fields be displayed on the side of the table. While I was able to create this, I wasn't very satisfied with how this looked on my page. So, I decided to put a collapsible sidebar on my page to store the filters when they are not being used.
### **Drawbacks and Recommendations:**
1. #### **No Submit/Reset Button**
    ![](https://github.com/annaS000/UFOs-pages/blob/main/static/images/filter.png?raw=true)
    > Filter Search would be more user-friendly if there were `Submit` and `Reset` buttons at the bottom of the search. This would allow the user to be able to make different searches quicker.
2. #### **Text Input**
    > Another aspect of the Filter Search I would change is the type of input fields. Having options for the user to choose from would make inputting searches easier. If the user is visiting the webpage for the first time, they may not know everything available to search for.
